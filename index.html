								<b>Understanding planets through their host stars</b>
								<br>
								The aim of my research is to study the influence of the host star on the formation 
								and evolution of exoplanets. This is done by using all-sky photometry from the
								TESS mission to measure the occurrence rates for exoplanets across the stellar spectrum, 
								from giant planets with the lowest mass host stars ever up to planetary systems whose 
								central star is evolving away from the main sequence. By uncovering the demographics of these
								populations we will better understand the birth, life, and even death of exoplanets.
								<br>
								I am also interested in finding and characterising new and exotic systems, like the 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..197B/abstract"> WASP-47 system</a>,
								to see what we can learn from them about potentially new formation pathways.
							</p>

								<b><a href="https://ngtransits.org">NGTS</a> Multi-Telescope Transit Observations</b>
								<br>
								I am also involved in the NGTS mission, particularly through the use of 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.5872B/abstract">multi-telescope observations</a>
								of exoplanet transit events. I use these observations to aid the 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Natur.583...39A/abstract">confirmation of new planets</a>,
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.5464K/abstract"> monitor TTVs in multi-planet systems</a>,
								and observe transits of the
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504L..45B/abstract"> longest period planets ever observed from the ground</a>.
								<br>
								We are always on the look out for <b> new collaborations </b> and exciting systems to observe. If you think we can help you out
								with any study please do get in touch!
								<br>
								As well as follow-up, NGTS remains a transit survey, and I work towards the discovery of new exoplanets,
								including leading the discovery for the sub-Saturn mass exoplanet
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.3139B/abstract">NGTS-12b</a>.

								<b>Lead author papers:</b> I have lead four peer-reviewed journal publications: <br>
								<i>Revisiting WASP-47 with ESPRESSO and TESS</i>; Bryant E. M. & Bayliss D. (2022), 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..197B/abstract">AJ, 163, 197</a> <br>
								I used high-precision radial velocities from ESPRESSO and new photometry from TESS to refine
								the parameters of the planets in the remarkable WASP-47 system. In particular, I refined the mass of
								the ultra-short period super-Earth WASP-47e, showing it to potentially have a different composition
								to most other well characterised super-Earths. <br>
								<br>
								<i>A transit timing variation observed for the long-period extremely low-density exoplanet HIP 41378 f</i>;
								Bryant E. M. et al. (2021), 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504L..45B/abstract">MNRAS, 504, L45-L50</a><br>
								Using multi-telescope NGTS observations I obeserved a transit of the 542day (!) period planet HIP-41378f.
								The NGTS observations, along with other ground-based photometry,
								revealed the presence of large transit timing variations for this planet. <br>
								<br>
								<i>NGTS-12b: A sub-Saturn mass transiting exoplanet in a 7.53 day orbit</i>; Bryant E. M. et al. (2020),
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.3139B/abstract">MNRAS, 499, 3139-3148</a> <br>
								Using NGTS survey photometry, along with further photmetry from TESS and radial velocity observations
								from HARPS and FEROS, I presented the 7.53d period, sub-Saturn mass exoplanet NGTS-12b. The host star
								NGTS-12 is slightly evolved and nearing the end of its life, so this planet likely doesn't have long left!
								The increase in luminosity as the star evolves also makes this low-density planet an interesting target
								for atmospheric characterisation studies and investigations into planetary inflation mechanisms. <br>
								<br>
								<i>Simultaneous TESS and NGTS transit observations of WASP-166 b</i>; Bryant E. M. et al. (2020),
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.5872B/abstract">MNRAS, 494, 5872-5881</a><br>
								I presented the NGTS multi-telescope observing method, where multiple of the twelve NGTS telescopes are
								used simultaneously to observe the same star. I demonstrated that this technique provides ultra high precision
								photometry, rivaling the data quality of the space telescope TESS!
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Contributed papers:</b><br>
								Using NGTS multi-telescope observations I have contributed to a large number of varied exoplanet discovery
								and characterisation studies. Through my involvement in a number of exoplanet discovery consorita, particularly
								the NGTS mission and various TESS follow-up programs with HARPS, I have also contributed to numerous exoplanet discoveries.<br>
